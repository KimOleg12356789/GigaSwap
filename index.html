              Retail and institutional liquidity is continuing to migrate toward the field of decentralized finance (DeFi), where trading takes place directly between the wallets of the seller (an individual or a contract selling an asset) and the buyer. This is good news for cryptocurrency traders as control is shifting from central exchanges to end users, allowing for the direct control and ownership of funds and anonymity in the process, the way cryptocurrency was intended to operate.

               GigaSwap will make it easy to find trading partners and simplify the development and agreement of terms amongst parties while eliminating the frustration of crossing chains. The GigaSwap dApp will allow its users on a verified network of traders to create listings of any asset that is on a supported chain and specify a quantity and price, either as a standalone listing or a grouping (e.g. selling multiple NFT’s). This can be listed publicly or to securely execute a previously negotiated transaction privately. The application will combine simplicity with configurability so that the majority of circumstances are covered without making it too complicated for the simplest: I have x, you would like to buy for y, let’s do it. Whether you’re in the day trading war room staring at monitor #4 of 9 or at the beach on a mobile device, the transactions you create and execute are guaranteed and secure.

                OTC stands for Over-The-Counter Trading whereby trades are done directly between two parties without the use of a central exchange or third party. There are multiple reasons traders may opt for this instead of open market trading, including avoidance of transaction tax on buys or sells, chart protection, and minimization of price impact. However, this type of trading can present risks to those involved since the transactions do not have a central marketplace or regulatory protection. GigaSwap solves this by enabling the OTC trading while providing security for any given transaction. <br><br>Participants in traditional OTC trading must agree on the terms of the transaction through anonymous platforms such as Discord, Telegram, and so on. This way of trading is based on cross-your-fingers pseudo-trust between these two unknown parties and therefore increases the risk of fraud. To prevent this situation, GigaSwap’s decentralized application (dApp) holds the role of a decentralized guarantor that deals with trade between two parties and executes independently on the terms of an agreement specified directly between the buyer and the seller, providing both security and anonymity to both parties.

               Bored A. Bob wants to exchange two NFT tokens for 1 ETH without having to account for excessively high seller fees that are typically seen. Art C. Alice is ready to buy these NFTs. Bob creates an order in GigaSwap, deposits two NFT tokens, then sends a link to the trade to Alice. Alice contributes 1 ETH to the application. After both participants confirm their intention and agree to terms, the application checks the fulfillment of the conditions and, if the conditions are met, the smart contract exchanges assets: Bob receives 1 ETH, and Alice receives two NFT tokens. Thus, the transaction takes place without risk for both parties, in addition, both parties can cancel or revise the terms of the exchange prior to execution. Bob and Alice are happy.

                A common challenge for new and even experienced DeFi users is trying to make transactions between unpaired assets or differing chains. This typically involves multiple step workarounds that often require the use of exchanges and associated fees, which can inhibit the true purpose of trading exclusively on DeFi. Even with a DeFi chain, users are often footing the bill for gas fees associated with exchanging assets in order to actually buy the asset they seek, which is costly and can waste precious time when trying to make a trade. For the vast majority of these circumstances, GigaSwap has you covered. <br><br>GigaSwap will be covering the most popular and high-volume chains for trading multiple assets across multiple chains in a single execution. On Day 1, GigaSwap will cover the entire spectrum of Ethereum assets which include ERC-20, ERC-721 (NFT), ERC-777, and ERC-1155. Are you trading to BSC or Polygon? GigaSwap will have you covered there as well and this functionality will follow within a month after the platform has gone live.

               Ethereum Esther has the vast majority of her assets in, well, you guessed it, Ethereum. She just learned of a new token that safely launched with a team she has researched and trusts. Based on her research, she likes the vision and wants to invest ASAP, but has learned that the token launched on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and she holds no BNB to purchase tokens. Worse yet, her very large, USA-based exchange doesn’t even have options to trade for BNB! Fortunately for her, she has found someone selling their tokens on GigaSwap. Esther offers ether for the equivalent USD amount that the seller has requested for, and a deal was reached! Without having to jump through hoops, Esther was able to use her favorite altcoin (ETH) to purchase an off chain token without dealing with an exchange or expensive bridge!

                The DeFi space is full of low liquidity options that carry a high risk / reward ratio which entices many speculative traders. Outside of the inherent risk of any investment in a low liquidity asset, traders on the open market need to battle against price impact, unscrupulous whales or top holders, front-running bots, and even excessive buy/sell transaction taxes on the contract itself. <br><br>GigaSwap mitigates risk in all the above by allowing users to circumvent these risk areas by allowing a direct transaction between a current holder and a prospective buyer. This is a classic win/win where the seller of a large holding can sleep well knowing that they did not harm the chart (OTC trades are transfers and do not show as a buy or sell) and subsequently the remainder of their holdings, and the buyer avoids getting front-run by a bot or losing liquidity due to high price impact. Both win by circumventing the buy/sell tax as a significant number of contracts do not tax transfers.

               Friendly Whale Willy has a ton of tokens in his favorite meme coin, making him a top holder. While he intends to hold most of these, he remembers that it’s always wise to take profits and diversify his portfolio. As such, he intends to offload 25% of his holdings. Seeing as the token still has relatively low liquidity, a sale of this size in the open market would cause a brutal red candle that would potentially damage the project, its holders, and the remainder of his holdings. To make matters worse, the price impact from such a sale is high and there is a sell tax on top! It was quite a dilemma for Willy until he found Dillon B. Dip. Dillon had the same token on his watchlist to purchase, and he found his entry to buy in and become a large holder. He was concerned about the price impact and the potential of being front run, and wasn’t thrilled about the buy tax either. Willy and Dillon matched on GigaSwap and made the exchange with the following great things taking place:
